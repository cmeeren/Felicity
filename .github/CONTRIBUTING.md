Contributor guidelines
======================

First of all – thanks for taking the time to contribute!

We welcome the contributions from non-members. That said, we’d like to do things right rather than fast. To make
everyone's experience as enjoyable as possible,
read [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) and please keep
the following things in mind:

- Unless it's a trivial fix, consider opening an issue first to discuss it with the team.
- For all pull requests, please follow the workflow described below.

Opening an issue
----------------

- Before opening an issue, please check if there's a known workaround, existing issue, or already a work in progress to
  address it.
- Provide as much relevant info as possible. If there’s an issue template, follow it if it makes sense.

Creating a pull request
-----------------------

(Based on https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Git-Workflow)

To contribute to Felicity while ensuring a smooth experience for all involved, please ensure you follow all of these
steps:

1. Fork Felicity on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Add the upstream repo: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:cmeeren/Felicity.git`
4. Create a local branch: `git checkout -b myBranch`
5. Work on your feature
6. Rebase if required (see below)
7. Push the branch up to GitHub: `git push origin myBranch`
8. Send a Pull Request on GitHub

You should **never** work on a clone of master, and you should **never** send a pull request from master - always from a
branch. The reasons for this are detailed below.

### Rebasing when handling updates from `upstream/master`

While you're working on your branch it's quite possible that your upstream master may be updated. If this happens you
should:

1. [Stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning) any un-committed changes you need to
2. `git checkout master`
3. `git pull upstream master`
4. `git rebase master myBranch`
5. `git push origin master` (optional; this this makes sure your remote master is up to date)

This ensures that your history is “clean”, with one branch off from master containing your changes in a straight line.
Failing to do this ends up with several messy merges in your history, which we’d rather avoid in order to keep the
project history understandable. This is the reason why you should always work in a branch and you should never be
working in, or sending pull requests from, `master`.

If you have pushed your branch to GitHub and you need to rebase like this (including after you have created a pull
request), you need to use `git push -f` to force rewrite the remote branch.

Also consider cleaning your commit history by squashing commits in an interactive rebase (not mandatory).

in [this guide](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history).

## Deployment checklist

For maintainers.

* Make necessary changes to the code
* Update the changelog
* Update the version and release notes in the fsproj files
* Commit and tag the commit in the format `v/x.y.z` (this is what triggers deployment from AppVeyor)
* Push the changes and the tag to the repo. If the AppVeyor build succeeds, the package is automatically published to
  NuGet.
